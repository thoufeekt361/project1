        <p>
          The Campus Complaint Management System (CCMS) is a web-based
          platform designed to simplify the process of reporting and
          managing complaints within a college campus.
        </p>

        <p>
          Students can easily submit complaints related to classrooms,
          laboratories, hostels, libraries, internet connectivity,
          electrical facilities, water supply, cleanliness, and other
          campus-related issues.
        </p>

        <p>
          The system allows students to track the progress of their
          complaints in real-time while administrators can efficiently
          review, manage, and resolve issues through a centralized
          dashboard.
        </p>
